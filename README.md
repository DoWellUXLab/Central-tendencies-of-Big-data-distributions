# Central Tendencies for Big Statistical Data API

Welcome to the Central Tendencies for Big Statistical Data API! This API provides a powerful endpoint to calculate various statistical tendencies for large datasets. It enables users to easily retrieve essential statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness, normal distribution, central moments, and raw moments. With this API, you can analyze and gain insights from your data with ease.

## Features

The Central Tendencies for Big Statistical Data API offers the following key features:

- **Mean Calculation**: Calculate the average value of a dataset.
- **Median Calculation**: Determine the middle value in a sorted dataset.
- **Mode Calculation**: Identify the most frequently occurring value(s) in a dataset.
- **Standard Deviation Calculation**: Measure the spread or dispersion of data points from the mean.
- **Kurtosis Calculation**: Determine the shape of the dataset's distribution and detect heavy tails or outliers.
- **Skewness Calculation**: Compute the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in the dataset's distribution.
- **Normal Distribution Analysis**: Analyze whether the dataset follows a normal distribution or deviates from it.
- **Central Moments Calculation**: Calculate measures providing insights into the shape, symmetry, and kurtosis of the dataset.
- **Raw Moments Calculation**: Compute measures providing insights into the central tendency and spread of the dataset.

## Results Categorization

The results of the Central Tendencies for Big Statistical Data API are categorized into two groups based on the provided data and calculation methodology:

- **Poisson Case Results**: In this case, the API calculates statistical tendencies for each list provided by the user individually. The calculations are performed separately for each list, enabling users to obtain insights into individual datasets.
- **Normal Case Results**: In this case, the API merges all the lists provided by the user into a single combined dataset. The statistical tendencies are then calculated for this merged dataset, enabling users to obtain overall insights into the combined data.

Please note that the categorization of results into "Poisson Case Results" and "Normal Case Results" allows users to analyze individual datasets separately or obtain overall tendencies for a merged dataset, based on their specific requirements and use cases.
